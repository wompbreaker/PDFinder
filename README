## Usage

	```
2. The program will output the search results, including the page number and context where the term was found.
3. Optionally, you can turn it into an executable. First install `pyinstaller` with `pip install pyinstaller` then run
	```
	pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --add-data "<CustomTkinter Location>/customtkinter;customtkinter/"  "<Path to Python Script>"
